      <br><li>For No. 7 is for all plastics other than those specified in No. 1-6 as well as plastics that may be layered or mixed with other plastics, such as bioplastics. </li>    
      <br><li>Designed as an umbrella class for polycarbonate (PC) and "other" plastics </li>    
      <br><li>BPA is xenoestrogen, a known endocrine disruptor. </li> 
      <br><li>A new generation of compostable plastics, made from biopolymers such as cornstarch, has been developed to replace polycarbonate and is also included in Category 7, which can be confusing to the consumer. These compostable plastics have the initials "PLA" at the bottom near the recycling symbol. </li>
      <br><li>Polylactic Acid or PLA is a biodegradable plastic generally made from cornstarch or sugar cane </li>
      <br><li>Polycarbonates are thermoplastics made of polymers that contain carbonate groups in their structure.</li>

        <br><li>Reuse protocols are not standardized under this category </li>    
        <br><li>It has been used in the manufacture of baby bottles, drinking cups, water-cooling bottles, and auto parts </li>    
        <br><li>Polycarbonate is a good alternative to glass and has a natural UV filter which is why it is commonly used in windows or eyeglasses. </li>    
        <br><li>PLA has a low melting point, relatively low shrinkage, and is insoluble in water, which makes it ideal for 3D printing at home. </li>

        <h2 class="fas fa-dumpster fa-2x" >How to get rid:</h2>
        <ul>
         <br><li>PLA-coded products should be tossed in the compost and not in the trash because PLA biodegradable plastic is not recyclable. </li>
         <br><li>Â· It is unlikely that you will be able to put this substance in your trash. You may be able to put in bottles or polycarbonate containers but it is best to check with your local authority first </li>

<div class="panel">
    
        <h2 class="fas fa-hard-hat fa-2x"  > safety:</h2>
        <ul>
          <br><li>The primary concern is the potential for leaching of chemicals into food or beverage products packaged in polycarbonate containers made with BPA (Bisphenol A) </li> 
          <br><li>BPA is found in polycarbonate plastic food packaging which is often marked at the bottom with the letter "PC" </li> 
          <br><li>Not reusable, unless it has compostable PLA coding</li> 
          <br><li>It's best to avoid No. 7 plastics, especially for baby food </li> 
          <br><li>The use of plastic in this category is at your own risk because you do not know what might be in it </li> 
          <br><li>The BPA inside the computer has been linked to many health issues including damage </li> 
          <br><li>Chromosomes in the female ovary, decreased sperm production in males, early puberty, and various behavioral changes. </li> 
          <br><li>One of the most useful properties of polycarbonate is that it is transparent, almost like glass, with its ability to withstand high shocks. It is also very flexible while at room temperature making it easy to work with for manufacturers. </li> 
          <br><li>Takes a long time to degrade in the environment </li> 
          <br><li>PLA is unique from many other plastics because it is biodegradable. </li>
